## Technical Implementation

### Database Schema
```python
class Question(models.Model):
    QUESTION_TYPES = [
        ('multiple_choice', 'Multiple Choice'),
        ('text_response', 'Text Response'),
    ]
    
    text = models.TextField()
    question_type = models.CharField(max_length=20, choices=QUESTION_TYPES)
    
    # Only used for multiple_choice:
    option1 = models.CharField(blank=True, null=True)
    option2 = models.CharField(blank=True, null=True)
    option3 = models.CharField(blank=True, null=True)
    option4 = models.CharField(blank=True, null=True)
    correct_option = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
```

### Response Storage
```python
class Response(models.Model):
    attendee = models.ForeignKey(Attendee)
    question = models.ForeignKey(Question)
    
    # For multiple_choice:
    selected_option = models.IntegerField(blank=True, null=True)
    
    # For text_response:
    text_response = models.TextField(blank=True, null=True)
    
    @property
    def is_correct(self):
        if self.question.question_type == 'multiple_choice':
            return self.selected_option == self.question.correct_option
        return None  # Text responses have no right/wrong
```

### Scoring Logic
```python
# Only count multiple choice questions for scoring
total_mc_questions = Question.objects.filter(
    class_session=session,
    question_type='multiple_choice'
).count()

correct_answers = sum(
    1 for r in responses 
    if r.question.question_type == 'multiple_choice' 
    and r.is_correct
)

score = (correct_answers / total_mc_questions * 100) if total_mc_questions > 0 else 0
```
