```

**To activate auto-fill:**
Add this to `survey/templates/survey/submit.html`:
```html
{% extends 'base.html' %}
{% load static %}

{% block extra_head %}
<script src="{% static 'js/autofill.js' %}" defer></script>
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<!-- Your existing form here -->
{% endblock %}
```

### 4. ✅ Password Encryption
**Status:** WORKING NOW!

Verify it:
```powershell
python manage.py shell

from survey.models import Attendee
att = Attendee.objects.first()
if att:
    print(att.password)
# ✅ Shows: pbkdf2_sha256$600000$... (encrypted!)
```

### 5. ✅ Timestamps for Records
**Status:** WORKING NOW!

All new participants will have:
- `created_at` - When they registered
- `updated_at` - Last modification time

---

## 🧪 Quick Tests

### Test 1: Session Code Auto-Generation
```
✅ Works immediately - no setup needed!
```

### Test 2: Email Sending (Console)
```powershell
python manage.py runserver
# Register a participant
# Check terminal for email output
```

### Test 3: Password Encryption
```powershell
python manage.py shell

from survey.models import Attendee
from django.contrib.auth.hashers import make_password, check_password

# Create test user
att = Attendee.objects.create(
    name="Test User",
    email="test@example.com",
    phone="1234567890",
    password=make_password("mypassword123")
)

# Verify password
print(check_password("mypassword123", att.password))  # Should print: True
print(check_password("wrongpassword", att.password))  # Should print: False
```

### Test 4: Auto-Fill API
```powershell
# Test the API endpoint directly
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/check-participant/ ^
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" ^
  -d "{\"email\":\"test@example.com\"}"

# Should return JSON with participant data if exists
```

## 📧 Email Configuration

### Current Setup: Console Backend ✅
**What this means:**
- Emails print to your terminal window
- Perfect for development and testing
- No external email account needed

**To see emails:**
```powershell
python manage.py runserver
# Register a user
# Look at the terminal - email content will be printed!
```

### Production Setup: Real Gmail Emails

**Step 1:** Get Gmail App Password
1. Go to Google Account → Security
2. Enable 2-Step Verification
3. Go to "App passwords"
4. Generate password for "Mail"
5. Copy the 16-character password

**Step 2:** Update `questionnaire_project/settings.py`

Find this section:
```python
# ===== Email Configuration =====
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend'
```

Replace with:
```python
# ===== Email Configuration =====
EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.smtp.EmailBackend'
EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'
EMAIL_PORT = 587
EMAIL_USE_TLS = True
EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'your-email@gmail.com'  # Your actual Gmail
EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = 'abcd efgh ijkl mnop'  # The 16-char app password
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL = 'Quiz Portal <your-email@gmail.com>'
```

**Step 3:** Test real email
```powershell
python manage.py runserver
# Register a user with real email
# Check their inbox - they should receive email!
```

## 🔒 Security Notes

### Passwords are SECURE:
- ✅ Encrypted with PBKDF2-SHA256
- ✅ 600,000 iterations
- ✅ Cannot be decrypted
- ✅ Admin cannot see real passwords

### What admin sees:
```
pbkdf2_sha256$600000$randomsalt$hashedpassword...
```

### This is CORRECT and SECURE! ✓

## 🎉 Summary

### What Works NOW:
1. ✅ Session codes auto-generate
2. ✅ Passwords encrypted
3. ✅ Emails print to console
4. ✅ Auto-fill API ready
5. ✅ Database indexes for speed
6. ✅ Timestamps on all records

### What Needs Setup:
1. ⚙️ Include auto-fill JavaScript in templates (optional)
2. ⚙️ Configure Gmail for real emails (optional)

### Start Testing:
```powershell
python manage.py runserver
```

Then:
1. Visit: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
2. Create a session as admin
3. Register as participant
4. Check terminal for emails
5. Test auto-fill with API

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Problem: Can't see participant passwords
**This is CORRECT!** Passwords are encrypted for security.
- Admin should never see passwords
- Use password reset if needed
- This protects user privacy

### Problem: Emails not showing
**Check terminal window** - emails print to console by default.
- Look for "Content-Type: text/plain"
- Should see full email content
- This is development mode

### Problem: Auto-fill not working
**JavaScript needs to be included in template:**
1. Open template file
2. Add `{% load static %}` at top
3. Add script in extra_head block
4. See example above
