# Changelog

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-14

### Changed - Registration Form Improvements

#### Modified Files:
1. `survey/forms.py`
2. `survey/views.py`
3. `survey/templates/survey/submit.html`

#### Details:

##### 1. Removed Optional Fields
- ‚ùå Removed `age` field from registration form
- ‚ùå Removed `place/city` field from registration form
- ‚ùå Removed `confirm_email` field from registration form

**Rationale**: Simplified registration process by removing unnecessary fields that were optional and not critical for quiz functionality.

##### 2. Made Password Mandatory
- ‚úÖ Password field is now **required** (was optional before)
- ‚úÖ Updated validation to enforce minimum 6 characters
- ‚úÖ Password must contain both letters and numbers for security
- ‚úÖ Updated UI to show password as required field with asterisk (*)
- ‚úÖ Removed "(optional)" text from password field label

**Rationale**: Ensures all students have secure accounts and must login to take quizzes, improving security and user tracking.

##### 3. Changed Registration Flow
- üîÑ Registration now redirects to **Student Login page**
- üîÑ Students must explicitly login after registration
- üîÑ Updated success message: "Please login to start your quiz"
- üîÑ Changed submit button text from "Register & Start Quiz" to "Register Account"

**Rationale**: Better security practice - students should explicitly authenticate after registration rather than being automatically logged in.

#### Form Structure Changes:

**Before:**
```python
fields = ['name', 'phone', 'email', 'age', 'place', 'class_session', 'password']
# password: required=False
# confirm_email: Extra field, required=False
```

**After:**
```python
fields = ['name', 'phone', 'email', 'class_session', 'password']
# password: required=True
# confirm_email: Removed
# age: Removed
# place: Removed
```

#### View Changes:

**Before (views.py):**
```python
attendee = form.save()
request.session['attendee_id'] = attendee.id
request.session['class_session_id'] = attendee.class_session_id
request.session['class_title'] = attendee.class_session.title
return redirect('quiz')  # Direct to quiz
```

**After (views.py):**
```python
attendee = form.save()
messages.success(request, "...Please login to start your quiz.")
return redirect('student_login')  # Redirect to login page
```

#### Template Changes (submit.html):

**Removed Sections:**
- Age input field and validation
- Place/City input field and validation
- Confirm Email input field and validation
- JavaScript validation code for removed fields

**Updated Sections:**
- Password field label: Added required asterisk (*)
- Password help text: Removed "(optional for quick access)"
- Submit button text: Changed to "Register Account"
- Added password validation message div

**JavaScript Validations Updated:**
- ‚úÖ Added password required validation
- ‚úÖ Added password minimum length (6 chars) validation
- ‚ùå Removed confirm_email matching validation
- ‚ùå Removed age validation (1-120 range)
- ‚ùå Removed place field validation
- ‚úÖ Kept password strength indicator

---

### Database Considerations

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important**: The database model (`survey/models.py`) still has `age` and `place` fields defined as nullable/optional. This means:

- Existing records with these fields will remain intact
- New registrations will have `NULL` or empty values for these fields
- No data loss for historical records

**Recommended Next Step**: Run migrations if you want to formally update the schema:
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

---

### Testing Checklist

Before deploying, verify:

- [ ] New student registration completes successfully
- [ ] Registration redirects to login page (not quiz)
- [ ] Success message displays correctly
- [ ] Password field validation works (required, min 6 chars)
- [ ] Password strength indicator shows correctly
- [ ] Login with newly registered credentials works
- [ ] After login, quiz starts normally
- [ ] Form submission validation catches all errors
- [ ] No JavaScript errors in browser console

---

### Backward Compatibility

‚úÖ **Fully backward compatible**:
- Existing student records are not affected
- Students with previously registered accounts can still login
- Old records with optional fields (age, place) remain functional
- No breaking changes to database structure

---

### Migration Notes

If you want to clean up the database model:

1. **Option A**: Keep age and place fields (recommended for now)
   - Fields remain nullable in model
   - Historical data preserved
   - Form simply doesn't include these fields

2. **Option B**: Remove fields from model (more aggressive)
   - Edit `survey/models.py` to remove `age` and `place`
   - Run `python manage.py makemigrations`
   - Run `python manage.py migrate`
   - Data for these fields will be lost

**Recommendation**: Keep fields in model for now, they won't cause issues.

---

### User Impact

**For New Students:**
- Simpler registration form (3 required fields instead of 6)
- Must create password (no optional quick access)
- Must login after registration

**For Existing Students:**
- No impact - can login as before
- Their existing data remains intact

**For Admins:**
- Registration process is more secure
- Better user tracking with mandatory passwords
- Cleaner registration data
