Sessions are automatically categorized based on current time:

- **✅ Active**: `start_time ≤ current_time ≤ end_time`
- **🔴 Finished**: `current_time > end_time`

This logic is implemented in:
- `views.py`: `admin_dashboard()`, `admin_session_view()`
- `admin.py`: `ClassSessionAdmin.session_status()`
