# 🎨 Homepage Redesign - Event-Based System

## Overview
The homepage has been completely redesigned to show **Current Events** and **Future Events** with live countdown timers. Users now select an event they want to attend, and a confirmation page asks "Do you want to attend this session?" before proceeding to login/registration.
