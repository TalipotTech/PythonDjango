## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Migration Error: "duplicate key value"
**Fix:** You have duplicate emails/phones in database

**Solution:**
```powershell
# Fresh start (easiest)
del db.sqlite3
python setup_email_features.py
```

### Auto-Fill Not Working
**Check:**
1. Is URL in `urls.py`? ✓ (I added it)
2. Is JavaScript included? (Need to add to template)
3. Browser console errors? (F12)

### Emails Not Sending (Production)
**Check:**
1. Gmail App Password correct?
2. 2FA enabled on Gmail?
3. Email settings in `settings.py`?
